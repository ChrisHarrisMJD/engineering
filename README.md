This project is hosted on Github Pages and is using Jekyll to build  the site. It is recommended that you use rbenv for your Ruby and GEM  environment. Here is a decent [guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) if you need help setting up Ruby.

Install the bundler by running:

```
$ gem install bundler:2.1.4
```

To set up your development environment first run the following from the root directory:

```
$ bundle install
```

To build the site and make it available on your local machine:

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
